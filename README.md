Algorithm Implementation
============================================================

- **Ford_Fulkerson**: Compute the maximum flow in a graph. Use case-> airport scheduling.[Java]
- **Horspool**: Finding substrings in strings given.*[C++]*
- **Knapsack_problem**: Optimization problem, given a set of items, each with a mass and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collecion so that the total weight is less than or
equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.*[C++]*
- **Reduction_to_SAT**: Determine if there exists an interpolation that satisfies a given boolean formula eg it establishes 
if the variables of a given boolean formula can be assigned in such a way as to make the formula evaluate to true. *[Java]*
- **Stable_marriage_problem**: Find a stable matching between two sets of elements given a set of preferences for each element.*[C++]*
- **Computational_Geometry_Applet**: A new functionality was added to the java applet by Joseph O'Rourke (view [http://cs.smith.edu/~orourke/books/CompGeom/CompGeom.html](http://cs.smith.edu/~orourke/books/CompGeom/CompGeom.html)). The user is now able to draw an [orthogonal polygon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectilinear_polygon "orthogonal polygons") and afterwards visually inspect its convex hull. See pictures of execution below. To run the applet type: 
 `appletviewer applet\CompGeom.html`. The following files contain the changes of the original code: CompGeomTest, GeomCanvas and ConvexHull2Dorth, which was not included in the orginal. *[Java]*
