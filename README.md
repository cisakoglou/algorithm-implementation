Algorithm Implementation
============================================================

- Ford_Fulkerson: Compute the maximum flow in a graph. Use case-> airport scheduling.[java]
- Horspool: Finding substrings in strings given.[C++]
- Knapsack_problem: Optimization problem, given a set of items, each with a mass and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collecion so that the total weight is less than or
equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.[C++]
- Stable_marriage_problem: Find a stable matching between two sets of elements given a set of preferences for each element.[C++]
- Reduction_to_SAT: Determine if there exists an interpolation that satisfies a given boolean formula eg it establishes 
if the variables of a given boolean formula can be assigned in such a way as to make the formula evaluate to true. [java]
